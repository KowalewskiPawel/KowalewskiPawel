## Hi there I'm Pawel ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

Software Engineer and former University Lecturer, I'm a coding and programming enthusiast with a primary focus on Web Development and related technologies that hold significant potential for positive impact. Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm an amateur electro-acoustic guitarist, motorcyclist, and rally enthusiast outside of working hours.

### My Motto - "Act, Reflect, Persist, Learn"

Education is the foundational step to solving nearly any conceivable problem. Particularly in contemporary times, the influence of education and technology becomes increasingly evident. Learning is my greatest passion, as it stands as one of the most gratifying aspects of life. It holds the potential to induce change, elevate life standards, and generate fresh possibilities. This is also a primary reason why I find programming so captivating!
